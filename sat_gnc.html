										<h3>Summary</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										In the vast landscape of satellite applications, ranging from high-speed internet to interstellar planet hunting, the possibilities are truly endless. 
										Over the course of nearly three years, I have been fortunate to contribute to this field by developing satellite control algorithms for Metrea Aerospace, 
										a company dedicated to delivering innovative solutions for national security. Working in a small startup environment, I was asked to take on the full range 
										of responsibilities required for translating engineering requirements into real software. 
										
										These included:
										<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
											1. Synthesizing controller specifications from high level mission CONOPs <br>
											2. Performing hardware trades for sensors and actuators and interfacing with vendors <br>
											3. Gathering and implementing relevant results from literature reviews of aerospace and control theory topics <br>
											4. Utilizing technical control theory to design novel, functional, and robust algorithms <br>
											5. Implementing designs in software using Python and C/C++ for embedded targets <br>
										</p>

										As part of the core avionics software team I was also tapped to help with a myriad of other tasks including the implementation of 
										communication protocols like CAN and RS485 and general maintenance of our development infrastructure (code repositories, VMs, etc.).
									</p>

										<h3>Significant Achievements</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Among the most impactful control solutions I delivered while at Metrea
										were 
										<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
											1. Nonlinear control for trajectory tracking: removed the need for gain scheduling around a large grid of linearized operating points and paved the way for 2. and 3.<br>
											2. Multibody dynamics formulation with quaternion base kinematics: allowed for higher fidelity simulation of satellites with actuated appendages <br>
											3. Guidance module which generated 5th order spline trajectories: provided smooth acceleration trajectories which in turn could be used to produce smooth feedforward actuator
											 efforts that stayed within physical limits <br>
										</p>
										All of these algorithms utilized the infamous quaternion as the kinematic description for satellite attitude which removed unwanted singularities caused by Euler angles, 
										and made the continous spline trajectories possible. It should also be noted that all of these software blocks were written in python with the only 3rd party dependencies being
										numpy and sympy (the multibody dynamics matrices were also converted to C for speed optimization). This was a must at a small company averse to large software subscriptions (MATLAB) and the desire for 
										easy plug and play on small linux computers. All software (including the highlighted algorithms) underwent unit testing and was then incorporated into our total system simulation, 
										where performance was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. In each case, my algorithms met their intended objectives and were successfully integrated into our software suite.
